The Advanced Computational Neuroscience Network ACNN aims to build broad consensus on the core requirements, infrastructure, and components needed to develop a new generation of sustainable interdisciplinary Neuroscience Big Data research. As a network, ACNN leverages community strengths and resources to drive innovation and collaboration for the understanding of the structure, physiology, and function of the human brain through partnerships and services in education, tools, and best practices. Six major universities in the Midwest (Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, Case Western, Northwestern and Washington U, St. Louis) coordinate the ACNN research, development, training, and dissemination activities. Over 25 other universities, industry partners, neuroscience research centers and hospitals collaborator with ACNN investigators on a wire range or basic science, modeling, analytics and applied neuroscience research.
